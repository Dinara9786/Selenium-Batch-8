Class 11

Actions class handles key and mouse actions.

Upload documents
In order to upload the file/documents we need to sendKeys(file path name).

If you are unable to sendKeys() you can also upload file by using Robot class.

Advanced Xpath:

Advanced xpath is based on parent and child, sibling relationship:

example: identifying the element by following sibling
//label[@id = 'nav-search-label']/following-sibling::input

example: identifying the element by preceding sibling
//span[text() = "& Orders']/preceding-sibling::span

identify elements by its parent
    Example
    //span[text() = '& Orders']/parent::a
    Syntax:
    //tagname[@attribute='attribute value']/parent::ParentTagName

    java script executor is interface, it is mechanism

    when we cannot use any other locator adn and any other actions like click() = >  we can
    use java script executor

    in testing we will not be using javascript often, this option serves only as back-up

    JS Executor:

    It is something that is present in our selenium tool and can be executed in different programming
    languages (java, C#, python etc)

    JavaScriptExecutor is an interface.

    We should only be using JavaScriptExecutor   only when we are not able to perform some actions such as :
    Click on elements
    Scroll the page
    Refresh the Page
    highlight the element
    scroll to a specific element

    What is POM:

    POM stands for Page Object Model
    It is a design pattern which is mainly used to enhance test maintenance and reduce code duplication.
    It is a structure, and increase test maintenance.

    Base class = we include = > configs files, base base actions, first actions we perform.
    Test classes = we will perform our actual actions which we have inside our webpages
    Utility classes (utils) = we have common actions, we develop more common actions

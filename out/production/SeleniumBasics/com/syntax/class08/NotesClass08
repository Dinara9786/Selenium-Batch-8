RECAP
Implicit wait will be applied only for findElement() and findElements() methods.

Explicit waits or WebDriver wait:

it is used to tell webdriver to wait for a expected condition before throwing
"ElementNotVisibleException".

Explicit wait works with expected condition class adn waits until the condition is met
or the given ime is achieved.

Fluent wait:
is  not used wait for Selenium. It is one of the global waits as well.  It is like implicit wait.
it is use to tell teh WebDriver to wait for certain condition as well as frequency before throwing
"ElementNotVisibleException"

WebTables:
WebTables are one of the elements in UI, which constructed by having rows and columns.

We have 2 types of webtables:

1. Static webtables
2. Dynamic webtables

 WebTables consist of different sections or parts -- tags
 <table>
        <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th></th> --> column
                </tr>
         </thead>
         <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td> --> table data
                </tr>
          </tbody>
 </table>


    <tr> is a table row
    <th> is a table heading and column as well
    <td> is a table data



Why the table is dynamic = we can add and delete data, it is changing.

    JSON = get ata from server side adn transfer it to client side/webPage
    JavaScript Object Notation = JSON

    // What is a WebElement or PageObject
            //links, text boxes, radio button, check boxes, drop down menus, images, buttons
            // in Selenium is the most important issue to locate element. We need to provide addres of the element we
            //work on, location of the webelement

            // for Selenium to do actions on page elements we have to provide location of each web element

            // How do we tell the location of page objects to Selenium? = > Locators in Selenium

            // id, tagName, xpath, css, class, linkText, partialLinkText

all elements start with tag and ends with tag adn start with html and closing with html.


if locator is dynamic but some part is stable then we can use stable part.

Locator
Xpath -- > absolute (native)
Xpath -- > relative
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']
// tagname[text() = 'text']


xml = extensible markup language = format for us to write our script or write our webapplication readable by

ALERTS

Alert is a pop up message. Alert takes complete focus from the webpage we ar eworking.
We cannot proceed further without handling an alert.

3 types of Alerts:

1. web based or html alerts - they are just a webelement on the page and we can inspect adn perform action =
= we can close, we can send keys, etc
2. Javascript alert/ or browser alerts = handle it by using switchTo() method
3. Windows based alerts = we cannot handle with Selenium.
Selenium can handle only webbased applications.
Window -based, operating system => Selenium cannot handle.

Types of JS Alerts:

1. simple alert = click ok.
2. Confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok.
3. Prompt alert = enter text adn click ok.

To handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods available:
1. accept()
2. dismiss()
3. getText()
4. sendKeyes()

    For authentication alerts the syntax is the following:
    public static String url = "http://test:test@abcdatabase.com/basicauth";
                                        username:password@


FRAMES
Frame is a separate adn independent window in a webpage.
Frames allow developers to present multiple views in one webpage.
in DOM = Any frame starts with iframe tagname.

We interact frames with 3 different ways:
1. by index
2. by name or ID
3. by webelement

In Alerts - switch manually and it switches back automatically

In Frames - we need to switch manually and switch back manually again

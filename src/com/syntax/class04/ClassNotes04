RECAP
why we need locator:

helps us identify the elements
identify element with any given attribute
developers may not provide wiht all the locators in the html

ABSOLETE is not reliable because it may change after website updates

 we control the drivers like chrome, fairfax etc
 developers do not control drivers

 advance xpath is it is relationship between parent, child and siblings

 parent is
 ancestor is

 CSS Selector is faster to locating the element than xpath. It is string pattern. We cannot go back.
 CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, it is another way to locate the element uniquely.

 SYNTAX:
 tagname[attribute = 'attribute value']
 Example:
 button[type='submit']

 in CSS we cannot identify element by text

 IMPORTANT: there is no specific condition when to go with xpath or CSS, this is just preference. In job we need to
 see the common practice of the project what my team uses.

SHORTCUTS for CSS: (Shortcuts are built-in features)
shortcut for className: tagname.classNameValue    dot . stands for class name
Example: input.nav-input

Shortcut for ID: "#" -- ID: tagname#idValue
Example: input#twotabsearchtextbox

contains() method in CSS:
* symbol represents contains() method -- tagname[attribute *= 'containing attribute value']

starts-with method in CSS:
^ symbol respresentas starts-with method
Syntax:tagname[attribute^='starting attribute value']
Example input[id^=btn]
div[id^='divP']

ends-with method in CSS:
$ symbol represents ends-with methods

Syntax: tagname[attribute$='ending attribute value']
Example: div[id$='word']
img[src $='syntax.png']


WebElement Commands: Consists of several methods where we can perfrom actions and get element state on the web page.

method/command
isEnabled() == will return boolean value
isEnabled () is used for verification
isSelected () == will return boolean; is used for checkboxes
isDisplayed () = will return boolean (ie logo etc)
clear() -- will return void, does not return anything. CLEAR can be used only in textbox.
clear() == It cannot be used for checkboxes
getText() == will return String value; get text and to compare with expected value.
getAttribute() = will return String, whenever we try use getAttribute we need to specify attribute itself
                and not the value

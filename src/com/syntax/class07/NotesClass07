Implicit wait tells yoru webdriver to wait for a certain aount to time before throwing an exception.
Implicit wait is written only once and will be applied for the whole session/exectuion. We can say
implicit wait is also a global wait.

Implicit wait is usually set to 20 seconds.
If your element is located in 3 seconds the rest time will be ignored and your script will move onto
the next action.

If the element is not found at the given time, only then it will through an exception. .

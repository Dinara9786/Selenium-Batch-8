What is a WebElement?

WebElement is anything we see on the webpage is considered to be a webelement = buttons,
dropdowns, textboxes, checkboxes
Anything is present on the web page is weblement.

HTML = stands for HyperTex Markup Language, create the layout for webpages
CSS will give design, CSS we need to style

What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a browser's internal view of the webbpage.
DOM is another way to call Develop's tool.
DOCUMENT == can be stored any document, like pdf excel or word. In HTML we can store any document.
OBJECT = any line inside HTML is called an Object
MODEL = is a layout of HTML file.

LOCATOR
Locator is the address or the position of the specific webelement in the webpage or inside DOM or HTML.
Locator is used to locate or identify a sedific element on the webpage.

There are 8 Locators:

1. id
2. name
3. className
4. linkText
5. partialLinkText
6. xpath
7. cssSelector
8. tagName

Why we need many locators?
-- Not all developers provide all the locators we need for webelements.
-- Some of locators can be dupicates or other notes. But we need only unique locator.
-- Some locators may not be applicable to all the elements.
        e.g. linkText adn PartialLInkText are only used applicable for link.

HTML scripting meaning:
First word in the line is tag
purple  = tags
orange or brown = attributes
blue = that comes after equal sign or in double quoates = attribute values
simple or regular text in black = is linktext, display text

What is "a" tag in html called an anchor tag.
href = is a link

ID is the most reliable locator. And in most cases is unique

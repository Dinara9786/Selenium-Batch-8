Page Object Model = pattern, it helps us reduce code adn maintain and organize everything = actions, code etc.
POM - Page Object Model = is a design pattern, and used for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication.
Also helps us organize our project.

How to implement:
2 ways:

1. POM without page factory
2. POM with page factory using @FindBy

PageFactory is a class which gives us an opportunity to interact with our stored elements inside each page class.

Purpose of the BASE CLASS = is open and close the browser
Constructor cannot be overriden.

BaseClass is fundamental.
